# FabMo-App-API

Libraries for helping FabMo app developpers

This API uses the [earcut library](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut).

**This API is very unstable for the moment and the development is nonregular.**

This API tends to follow those rules:

1. This API is modular.
2. This is minimalist as possible. It does not offer a lot of functionnalities.
   Functionnalities will be added if they seem to be missing and important.
